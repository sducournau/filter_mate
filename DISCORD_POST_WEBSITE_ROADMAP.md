:globe_with_meridians: **FilterMate Has a New Home — and a Roadmap to 5.0**

Hey everyone! Two things to share today:

---

:rocket: **New Website Is Live**
We just launched a brand-new landing page for FilterMate:
:point_right: **https://imagodata.github.io/filter_mate/**

5 sections covering everything: performance benchmarks, workflows, quality metrics, and a quick install guide. Clean, dark-themed, mobile-friendly. Check it out!

:world_map: **Roadmap: Raster & LiDAR Filtering (FilterMate 5.0)**
This is the big one. FilterMate is expanding beyond vectors.
:point_right: **https://imagodata.github.io/filter_mate/roadmap.html**

Here's what's coming:

**Raster Filtering**
:bar_chart: **Zonal Statistics as Filter** — compute min/max/mean/std inside your polygons, then filter by the results. *No other QGIS plugin does this.*
:dart: Raster value sampling at polygon centroids
:eye: Dynamic pixel masking when filters are active
:chart_with_upwards_trend: Interactive histogram for threshold picking
:package: Clip & export raster to GeoTIFF/COG

**LiDAR & Point Cloud**
:triangular_flag_on_post: ASPRS classification filter (Ground, Vegetation, Buildings, Water...)
:level_slider: Elevation & intensity range sliders
:jigsaw: Multi-criteria combiner
:outbox_tray: Polygon clip & LAZ/COPC export

**Timeline:** 5 sprints, targeting FilterMate 5.0
- Sprint 0-1: Raster foundations + sampling → Alpha Raster
- Sprint 2: Zonal stats + histogram → Beta Raster
- Sprint 3: Raster highlight + point cloud architecture → Raster V1
- Sprint 4: Point cloud complete → **FilterMate 5.0**
