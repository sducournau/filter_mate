fix(spatialite): improve second filter list loading diagnostics and auto-retry (v3.0.2)

🐛 Problem Fixed
--------------
Second filter in multi-step Spatialite filtering would sometimes fail to load 
the feature list, leaving the widget empty with no clear error message.

Affected:
- Spatialite/OGR backends in multi-step filtering mode
- Second filter with selection tool active
- Layers where buildFeaturesList task failed silently

✅ Solutions Implemented
-----------------------

1. Enhanced Diagnostic Logging (modules/widgets.py)
   - loadFeaturesList: Detailed logging when list is empty
   - Distinguishes between "0 features in layer" vs "list load failed"
   - Shows layer feature count, provider type, and subset string
   - CRITICAL alert when layer has features but list is empty

2. Automatic Retry for Spatialite/OGR (modules/widgets.py)
   - Detects empty widget 500ms after task launch
   - Auto-triggers layer reload + setDisplayExpression retry
   - Resolves temporary DB lock issues without user intervention
   - Smart: only retries when layer has features but list is empty

3. Multi-Step Filter Logging (modules/backends/spatialite_backend.py)
   - Clarifies FID filter replacement behavior in multi-step mode
   - Visual indicators (✅/⚠️) for filter combination vs replacement
   - Detailed logging of why old_subset is skipped or combined
   - Documents expected behavior when source geometry changes

4. buildFeaturesList Enhanced Logging (modules/widgets.py)
   - Shows layer feature count vs features_list length
   - Displays subset string and filter expression
   - Helps diagnose why list construction failed

📊 Impact
--------
- Better diagnostics: Clear logs explain exactly what went wrong
- Auto-recovery: Spatialite/OGR layers retry automatically on failure
- User experience: Fewer manual layer reloads needed
- Developer: Easier to debug multi-step filter issues

🔍 Technical Details
------------------
Multi-step Spatialite behavior clarified:
- Step 1: Filter batiment → FID filter "fid IN (...)" on distant layers
- Step 2: Filter ducts (different source) → Cache invalidated, FID filter REPLACED
- This is CORRECT behavior (not a bug) - now clearly logged

Files Modified:
- modules/widgets.py (3 improvements)
- modules/backends/spatialite_backend.py (2 improvements)
- docs/FIX_SECOND_FILTER_LIST_LOAD_v2.9.44.md (new documentation)
