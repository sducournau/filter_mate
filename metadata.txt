about=FilterMate v2.0 - Production-Ready Multi-Backend Plugin!

 NEW in v2.0:
 - STABLE: Production-ready release with comprehensive testing

 - RELIABLE: SQLite database lock management with retry logic
 - IMPROVED UI: Enhanced theme support and user feedback
 - BUG FIXES: Critical fixes for undo/redo and field selection
 - PERFORMANCE: Optimized query execution with predicate ordering
 
 Core features:
 - Works with ANY data source (Shapefile, GeoPackage, Spatialite, PostgreSQL)
 - Automatic backend selection (PostgreSQL, Spatialite, or Local)
 - Intuitive search and selection of entities
 - Filter vector layers by expression and geometric predicates
 - Buffer support with automatic geometry repair
 - Configure widgets independently for each layer
 - Export layers intuitively
 - Automatic CRS reprojection on the fly
 - Filter history with easy undo/redo
 
 Performance: Automatically uses PostgreSQL when available for optimal speed, falls back to Spatialite or local backend otherwise.
