about=FilterMate v1.9 - Now works WITHOUT PostgreSQL!

 NEW in v1.9:
 - Works with ANY data source (Shapefile, GeoPackage, Spatialite, PostgreSQL)
 - Automatic backend selection (PostgreSQL, Spatialite, or Local)
 - No PostgreSQL server required (optional for large datasets)
 - Performance warnings for large datasets
 - Improved error messages and user feedback
 
 Core features:
 - Intuitive search and selection of entities
 - Filter vector layers by expression and geometric predicates
 - Buffer support for geometric filtering
 - Configure widgets independently for each layer
 - Export layers intuitively
 - Automatic CRS reprojection on the fly
 - Filter history with easy undo/redo
 
 Performance: Automatically uses PostgreSQL when available for optimal speed, falls back to Spatialite or local backend otherwise.
