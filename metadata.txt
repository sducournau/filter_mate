about=FilterMate will change your daily life with QGIS, it allows you to:

 - a more intuitive search for entities in a layer.
 - make selections simplier.
 - be able to review each entity.
 - filter your vector layers by expression and by geometric predicates, using a buffer if necessary.
 - it allows you to configure the differents widgets and save them independently for each layer.
 - export your layers more intuitively.
 
 It adapts to your data, takes advantage of PostGIS when possible, manages differents CRS by reprojecting on the fly. The layers keep a history of each subset, making it easy to return to the previous state.
