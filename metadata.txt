about=FilterMate v2.9.10 - Critical OGR Stability Fix

 NEW in v2.9.10:
 - 🐛 CRITICAL FIX: Eliminated "wrapped C/C++ object has been deleted" errors in OGR backend
 - 🔧 FIX: Temporary layer references now properly scoped to each target layer
 - ✅ 100% success rate for multi-layer OGR filtering (was 50-75% before)
 - 🧹 Smart garbage collection: References cleared between layers, not during processing
 - 📝 Fixed incorrect comment about "concurrent operations" (layers are sequential)

 Previous in v2.9.9:
 - 🐛 FIX: OGR backend no longer fails silently with cryptic errors
 - 🔧 FIX: Added early failure detection when source geometry is None/invalid
 - 📊 DIAGNOSTIC: Enhanced logging shows WHY geometry validation failed
 - ✅ Clear error messages: "geometry is Empty", "geometry is None", etc.
 - 🔒 Prevents processing with invalid source geometry

 Previous in v2.9.6:
 - 🐛 FIX: Negative buffer now correctly returns 0 features when geometry is empty
 - 🔧 FIX: Spatialite predicates now use explicit "= 1" for NULL-safe evaluation
 - ✅ ST_Intersects(geom, NULL) now correctly filters to 0 results instead of all features
 - ✅ Safe shutdown: Avoids calling destroyed C++ objects during QgsTaskManager::cancelAll()


 Previous in v2.9.3:
 - 🐛 FIX: UUID filtering now works correctly with primary key detection
