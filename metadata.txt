about=FilterMate v2.9.6 - Spatialite NULL Geometry Fix

 NEW in v2.9.6:
 - 🐛 FIX: Negative buffer now correctly returns 0 features when geometry is empty
 - 🔧 FIX: Spatialite predicates now use explicit "= 1" for NULL-safe evaluation
 - ✅ ST_Intersects(geom, NULL) now correctly filters to 0 results instead of all features
 - 🔒 Prevents silent filter failures with complex buffer operations

 Previous in v2.9.5:
 - 🐛 FIX: Windows crash during QGIS shutdown (fatal access violation)
 - 🔧 FIX: Task cancellation now uses Python logger instead of QgsMessageLog
 - ✅ Safe shutdown: Avoids calling destroyed C++ objects during QgsTaskManager::cancelAll()

 Previous in v2.9.4:
 - 🐛 FIX: Spatialite large dataset filtering now works correctly
 - 🔧 FIX: Replaced SQL subquery with range-based filter for OGR compatibility
 - ✅ Filter expressions now use BETWEEN/IN() instead of unsupported subqueries

 - 🐛 FIX: UUID filtering now works correctly with primary key detection
