about=FilterMate v2.3.2 - Minor fixes and documentation updates

 NEW in v2.3.0:
 - ⭐ FEATURE: Intelligent Undo/Redo with automatic context detection
 - 🔄 Smart Mode: Source-only or Global multi-layer restoration
 - 🎯 UX: Auto-enable/disable buttons, clear feedback messages
 - 🏗️ Architecture: Task modules extracted (appTasks.py -99%%)
 - ✅ Quality: PEP 8 95%%, 26 automated tests, CI/CD active
 - 🚀 Performance: Geometry caching (5× speedup for multi-layer ops)

 Previous (v2.2.5): Automatic EPSG:3857 conversion for geographic CRS
 
 Core features:
 - Works with ANY data source (Shapefile, GeoPackage, Spatialite, PostgreSQL)
 - Automatic backend selection (PostgreSQL, Spatialite, or Local)
 - Intuitive search and selection of entities
 - Filter vector layers by expression and geometric predicates
 - Buffer support with automatic geometry repair
 - Configure widgets independently for each layer
 - Export layers intuitively
 - Automatic CRS reprojection on the fly
 - Filter history with easy undo/redo
 
 Performance: Automatically uses PostgreSQL when available for optimal speed, falls back to Spatialite or local backend otherwise.
