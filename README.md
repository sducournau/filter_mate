**FilterMate is a Qgis plugin, a daily companion that allows you to easily explore, filter and export vector data**

*FilterMate will change your relationship to QGIS, it allows you to:*
- *a more intuitive search for entities in a layer.*
- *make selections more simply.*
- *be able to review each entity.*
- *filter your vector layers by expression and by geometric predicate, using a buffer if necessary.*
- *it allows you to configure the different widgets and save them independently for each layer.*
- *export your layers more intuitively.*
<br>
*It adapts to your data, takes advantage of PostGIS when possible, manages different CRS by reprojecting on the fly.*
<br>
*The layers keep a history of each subset, making it easy to return to the previous state.*
