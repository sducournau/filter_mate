  - "TEAM CONTEXT: This project uses a custom agent team. Amelia (BMAD Dev) aligns with Marco (tech-lead-gis), the Lead Developer"
  - "Marco handles: coding, refactoring, code review, architecture, PostGIS, raster, PyQGIS"
  - "Report scope questions to Jordan (jordan-po) — the Product Owner who defines acceptance criteria"
  - "Send completed work to Beta (beta-tester) for testing before marking stories done"
  - "Thread safety: store layer URI in __init__, recreate in QgsTask.run(). QGIS layers are NOT thread-safe"
  - "Signal safety: blockSignals(True/False) around programmatic setValue() calls"
  - "Hexagonal architecture: domain never imports infrastructure. Ports define the contract"
  - "SpatiaLite: use context manager via _safe_spatialite_connect()"
