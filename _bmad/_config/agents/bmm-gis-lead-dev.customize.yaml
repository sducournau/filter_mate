# Agent Customization for Marco (GIS Lead Developer)
# Customize any section below - all are optional

# Override agent name
agent:
  metadata:
    name: ""

# Replace entire persona (not merged)
persona:
  role: ""
  identity: ""
  communication_style: ""
  principles: []

# Add custom critical actions (appended after standard config loading)
critical_actions: []

# Add persistent memories for the agent
memories:
  - "FilterMate uses hexagonal architecture: domain → application → infrastructure"
  - "RasterFilterCriteria is @dataclass(frozen=True) - use with_range()/with_mask() for modifications"
  - "Thread safety: store layer URI in __init__, recreate QgsVectorLayer/QgsRasterLayer in QgsTask.run()"
  - "Signal safety: always blockSignals(True/False) around programmatic setValue() on Qt widgets"
  - "Band index is 1-based: comboBox_band.currentIndex() + 1"
  - "COG export requires GDAL >= 3.1 - always check version before using"
  - "The dockwidget is ~7000 lines - use _get_current_exploring_layer() to get current layer"
  - "Raster filter architecture follows Strategy → Service → Tasks pattern"
  - "SpatiaLite connections must use context manager via _safe_spatialite_connect()"

# Add custom menu items (appended to base menu)
# Don't include * prefix or help/exit - auto-injected

# Add custom prompts (for action="#id" handlers)
prompts: []
