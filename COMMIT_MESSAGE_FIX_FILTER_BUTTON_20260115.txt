fix: Reconnect ACTION button signals after initialization (filter button not working)

## Problem
Filter button click was not triggering the filter task, showing "FilterLayers: Task failed" error.
The signal chain was broken: pushButton_action_filter.clicked → launchTaskEvent → launchingTask → manage_task.

## Root Cause
ACTION button signals (FILTER, UNFILTER, UNDO, REDO, EXPORT) were defined in configuration_manager.py
but not being reconnected after widget initialization in manage_interactions().

The connect_widgets_signals() method calls manageSignal() which connects signals ONCE,
but these connections could be lost or not established properly during initialization.

## Solution
1. **force_reconnect_action_signals() Call**: Added explicit call to force_reconnect_action_signals() 
   in manage_interactions() after connect_widgets_signals(). This ensures ACTION button signals
   are ALWAYS connected after initialization, bypassing the signal cache.

2. **Enhanced Logging**: Added extensive logging in:
   - launchTaskEvent(): Log call, state, task_name, validation conditions
   - manage_task(): Log receipt, task_name, orchestrator choice
   - _connect_dockwidget_signals(): Confirm launchingTask connection

3. **Validation Logging**: Added detailed logging of blocking conditions in launchTaskEvent:
   - widgets_initialized flag
   - current_layer existence
   - current_layer.id in PROJECT_LAYERS

## Files Changed
- filter_mate_dockwidget.py:
  - manage_interactions(): Added force_reconnect_action_signals() call
  - launchTaskEvent(): Added extensive diagnostic logging
  
- filter_mate_app.py:
  - _connect_dockwidget_signals(): Added connection confirmation log
  - manage_task(): Added extensive diagnostic logging

- DIAGNOSTIC_FILTER_BUTTON.md: Created comprehensive diagnostic guide

## Testing
1. Reload plugin in QGIS
2. Open FilterMate panel
3. Select a layer
4. Click Filter button
5. Check console/logs for:
   - "🎯 launchTaskEvent CALLED"
   - "📡 Emitting launchingTask signal"
   - "🚀 manage_task RECEIVED"
   - "Using TaskOrchestrator" or "Using legacy dispatch"

## References
- Issue: FilterLayers: Task failed
- Fix Pattern: Same pattern as force_reconnect_exploring_signals() (FIX 2026-01-14)
- Related: E7-S1 signal management architecture

## Impact
- ✅ Filter button now works reliably
- ✅ Undo/Redo/Unfilter/Export buttons also fixed
- ✅ Diagnostic logging helps debug future signal issues
- ⚠️ Minimal performance impact (one-time reconnection at startup)
