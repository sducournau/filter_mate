fix(exploring): Fix IDENTIFY, ZOOM, and RESET buttons not responding to clicks

PROBLEM
-------
pushButton_exploring_identify, pushButton_exploring_zoom, and 
pushButton_exploring_reset_layer_properties were not triggering their actions
when clicked. The buttons appeared in UI but clicking had no effect.

ROOT CAUSE
----------
Signal connection failure: The buttons were defined in widgets dict with their
signal handlers, but manageSignal() was NOT successfully connecting these signals,
even though connect_widgets_signals() was being called.

The reason is unclear but likely related to the order of widget initialization or
a Qt-specific issue with these particular standard QPushButton widgets (vs QGIS
custom widgets which all work fine via manageSignal).

SOLUTION
--------
Direct signal connection instead of relying on manageSignal() for ALL three
standard QPushButton widgets in EXPLORING tab.

CHANGES
-------
1. filter_mate_dockwidget.py - manage_interactions()
   - Added explicit .clicked.connect() for IDENTIFY, ZOOM, and RESET
   - Added logging to confirm connection success

2. ui/controllers/exploring_controller.py - _reload_exploration_widgets()
   - Added reconnection after widget layer updates for all 3 buttons
   - Disconnect before connect to prevent duplicate connections
   - TypeError catch for graceful handling when not connected
   - Loop pattern for cleaner code

FUNCTIONALITY
-------------
- pushButton_exploring_identify: Opens QGIS Identify Results panel showing
  attributes for selected feature(s)

- pushButton_exploring_zoom: Zooms map canvas to extent of selected feature(s)

- pushButton_exploring_reset_layer_properties: Resets all layer properties
  to their default values

TESTING
-------
✅ Click IDENTIFY → opens identify panel with feature attributes
✅ Click ZOOM → map zooms to selected features
✅ Click RESET → resets layer properties to defaults
✅ Works in single selection mode
✅ Works in multiple selection mode
✅ Works after layer change
✅ No duplicate connections after widget reload

PATTERN
-------
For standard Qt widgets (QPushButton), prefer direct connection:
  self.button.clicked.connect(self.handler)

For QGIS custom widgets, manageSignal() works perfectly.
