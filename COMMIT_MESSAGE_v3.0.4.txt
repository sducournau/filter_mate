fix: Reconnect IDENTIFY/ZOOM signals after layer change (v3.0.4)

CRITICAL FIX - Exploring buttons signal reconnection after filter + layer change

## Problem
pushButton_exploring_identify and pushButton_exploring_zoom became non-functional
after applying a filter then changing to another layer. The buttons' signals were
disconnected during layer changes but never reconnected, leaving them permanently
disabled.

## Root Cause
Signal management inconsistency across three functions:
1. _disconnect_layer_signals() - IDENTIFY/ZOOM not in disconnect list
2. _reload_exploration_widgets() - IDENTIFY/ZOOM signals not reconnected
3. _reconnect_layer_signals() - IDENTIFY/ZOOM not in widgets_to_reconnect list

Result: Buttons remained disconnected after layer changes.

## Solution
Three-part fix ensuring complete signal lifecycle:

1. filter_mate_dockwidget.py::_disconnect_layer_signals()
   - Added ["EXPLORING", "IDENTIFY"] to widgets_to_stop
   - Added ["EXPLORING", "ZOOM"] to widgets_to_stop
   - Ensures explicit disconnect tracking

2. filter_mate_dockwidget.py::_reload_exploration_widgets()
   - Added manageSignal(["EXPLORING","IDENTIFY"], 'connect', 'clicked')
   - Added manageSignal(["EXPLORING","ZOOM"], 'connect', 'clicked')
   - Guarantees reconnection after widget reload

3. filter_mate_dockwidget.py::_reconnect_layer_signals()
   - Added ["EXPLORING", "IDENTIFY"] to exploring_signal_prefixes
   - Added ["EXPLORING", "ZOOM"] to exploring_signal_prefixes
   - Prevents double-reconnection errors

## Impact
✅ IDENTIFY button functional after filter + layer change
✅ ZOOM button functional after filter + layer change
✅ No double-reconnection errors
✅ All backends supported (PostgreSQL/Spatialite/OGR)
✅ Complete signal lifecycle symmetry

## Testing
- Manual: Filter → Layer change → Buttons work ✅
- Backends: PostgreSQL, Spatialite, OGR (GeoPackage, Shapefile) ✅
- Edge cases: Rapid layer switching, multi-step filters ✅

## Files Changed
- filter_mate_dockwidget.py (3 functions updated)
  - _disconnect_layer_signals() - Line ~9446
  - _reload_exploration_widgets() - Line ~9711
  - _reconnect_layer_signals() - Line ~10036
