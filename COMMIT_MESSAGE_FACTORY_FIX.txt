fix(hexagonal): Initialize QGIS factory before AppInitializer starts

CRITICAL FIX: Plugin failed to start with RuntimeError due to missing
port initialization in hexagonal architecture.

Problem:
- AppInitializer (core service) called get_qgis_factory()
- But set_qgis_factory() was never called during startup
- Violated hexagonal architecture dependency injection contract
- Result: "QGIS factory not initialized" RuntimeError

Solution:
- Added QGISFactory initialization to app_bridge.initialize_services()
- Factory now created BEFORE any core services use it
- Added proper cleanup in cleanup_services()
- Follows hexagonal architecture initialization order:
  1. Adapters initialize ports (set_qgis_factory)
  2. Services use ports (get_qgis_factory)
  3. Application logic runs

Changes:
- adapters/app_bridge.py:
  + Initialize QGISFactory first in initialize_services()
  + Reset factory in cleanup_services()
  + Added logging for initialization tracking

Impact:
- Plugin now starts successfully
- AppInitializer no longer falls back to legacy mode
- Hexagonal architecture properly initialized
- No regression risk (was completely broken before)

Testing:
✅ Plugin reload works
✅ No RuntimeError on startup
✅ Factory available to all core services
✅ Cleanup resets factory properly
