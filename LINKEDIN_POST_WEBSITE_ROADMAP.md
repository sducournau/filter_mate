## Post

```
I built a QGIS plugin that filters spatial data 8× faster.

No SQL. No scripts. Just click.

Here's what FilterMate does that nothing else can 👇

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📍 Click a feature on the map.
↳ Every related layer filters instantly.
↳ Buffer, intersection, containment — built in.

That's it. That's the workflow.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

⚡ But speed is where it gets interesting.

┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ PostgreSQL  → 1M features in ~10s  │
│ SpatiaLite  → 100k features in ~10s │
│ GeoPackage → 10k features in ~5s    │
└─────────────────────────────────┘

4 built-in optimizers. Smart caching.
2-8× faster than manual SQL filtering.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔧 What's under the hood:

✅ 600 automated tests
✅ 5 backends (PostgreSQL, SpatiaLite, GeoPackage, Shapefiles, WFS)
✅ 22 languages
✅ Undo/Redo on every filter
✅ Dark mode that adapts to your QGIS theme
✅ One-click export to GeoPackage with styles
✅ Favorite filters you can save and share

100% open source. GPL-3.0. 🔓

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🚀 And what's coming next is even bigger.

FilterMate 5.0 will filter vectors by raster values.

💬 "Show me only parcels where average elevation > 500m."

🛰️ Zonal statistics computed inside your polygons.
📊 Interactive histogram to pick thresholds.
🧵 Background-threaded — no UI freeze on 1 GB rasters.

→ No other QGIS plugin does this.

Plus: LiDAR point cloud filtering 🌲
ASPRS classification · elevation sliders · multi-criteria.
First-ever native point cloud filtering in a QGIS plugin.
